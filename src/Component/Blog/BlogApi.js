    title_one: "A beginners guide to NFTs",
    desc_one: "An NFT is a digital asset stored on a blockchain that is unique and impossible to replicate.NFTs can represent anything from digital art to in-game items and even real-world assets like land or houses. Almost anything can be tokenized and stored on a blockchain as an NFT.The key feature that makes NFTs so special and different from other digital assets is that they are non-fungible. This means that each NFT cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided.",
    title_two: "What does non-fungible mean?",
    desc_two: "‘Fungibility’ is a property of goods or commodities whose individual units are interchangeable.For example, one US dollar can always be exchanged with another US dollar. A barrel of crude oil is pretty much the same as any other barrel of crude oil.This is not the case with NFTs.NFTs are ‘non’-fungible precisely because each one is unique and cannot be replaced.",
    title_three: "The future value of NFTs",
    desc_three: "NFTs have exploded in popularity in recent months and have resulted in some very high-profile sales, such as the $69 million sale of an NFT digital artwork by the artist Beeple.As NFTs become more popular, we are likely to see even more unique use-cases arise.NFTs have many ways to grow, and they’ll be important anywhere security, authenticity, and identity is valuable.",
    title_four: "Why do NFTs matter?",
    desc_four: "Each NFT has its own individual history that can be traced back to the original owner. This makes them perfect for collectibles, or for any digital asset where provenance (or ownership history) is important.The uniqueness of each NFT means that they can also be used to represent real-world assets. For example, an NFT could represent a deed to a piece of land or a ticket to a concert.While NFTs are still a relatively new phenomenon, they are already having a major impact on the world of digital art and collectibles. With more people becoming aware of NFTs, it is likely that we will see even more innovative uses for them in the future.",
    title_five: "How are NFTs stored?",
    desc_five: "NFTs are stored on a blockchain, which is a digital ledger that records all transactions.While there are many different types of blockchains, the most popular ones for NFTs are Ethereum and Solana.",
    title_six: "How do NFTs work?",
    desc_six: "NFTs are created using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that enforce the terms of a transaction.For example, let’s say you want to buy an NFT digital artwork. The smart contract would automatically transfer the ownership of the artwork to you once it has been verified that you have paid for it. The data of this transaction is then added to the blockchain, creating a permanent record.",
    title_seven: "What are the criticisms of NFTs?",
    desc_seven: "Critics of NFTs argue that they are a waste of energy, as the process of minting an NFT requires a lot of computational power.While it is true that most NFTs do not have any physical form, many people believe that they will eventually be used to represent real-world assets, which would give them value.",
    title_eight: "What are the benefits of NFTs?",
    desc_eight: <text>
    They allow artists to sell their work directly to fans, without going through intermediaries.<br />
    NFTs offer a way for creators to sell their work directly to fans without going through intermediaries. This allows artists to retain a greater share of the profits from their work. The smart contracts may also embed a royalty component which means the artists continue to receive a royalty payment for subsequent sales of the art over time.<br />
    <br />
    They help prove the authenticity of digital assets and ownership.<br />
    NFTs offer a way to create provable scarcity for digital assets. With traditional digital assets, it is very easy to make perfect copies. This means that there is no way to ensure that the asset you are buying is truly unique. With NFTs, each asset is stored on a blockchain and has a unique identifier. This means that you can be sure that you are the only person who owns that particular asset.<br />
    <br />
    They have the potential to represent real-world assets.<br />
    Thanks to the blockchain, NFTs prove the authenticity of an asset, along with ownership, and that record can never be altered, faked, or forged–unlike most digital and physical records that exist today. Therefore, they have the ability to represent real-world assets.<br />

    title_one: "What is Front-End Development?",
    desc_one: "When you’re using a website or app, everything you can see and interact with is down to frontend development. A frontend developer’s job is to design the look and feel of the website – from the buttons, fonts and colours to the general layout. They are charged with making the user experience as good as it can possibly be, across a range of browsers, platforms and devices. They do this by using a combination of design, technology and programming tools.",
    title_two: "Common frontend developer tasks",
    desc_two: <text>
    A frontend developer would be expected to take on any of the following:<br />
    -Designing and overseeing the user experience of an app or website<br />
    -Using programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the frontend<br />
    -Maintaining and updating the user interface<br />
    -Developing new tools to improve interaction with the website or app<br />
    -Carrying out testing and debugging<br />

    <br />
    Technical skills
    </text>,
    desc_three: <text>
    Web design<br />
    A frontend developer needs to have a mastery of the design element of an application, with an understanding of visual layout and functionality, as well as the technology that underpins interface design. They should have experience using programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator.<br />
    <br />
    UX design <br />
    Aside from the visual aspect, frontend developers must also have expertise at developing the user experience. Understanding how the user will interact with the website or app and knowing how to optimise the experience are key factors. They must also understand the fundamentals of responsive design, as every modern website or app is now used across multiple platforms and devices.<br />
    <br />
    Testing and debugging<br />
    Examining code within a website and detecting errors is part of designing the user experience. Frontend developers must have a wide range of knowledge of various testing frameworks across different programming languages.<br />
    <br />
    Programming languages<br />
    HTML – the starting point for any budding frontend developer, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) makes up the building blocks to every website or app. HTML lets the browser know how to display the website<br />
    CSS – the decorative tool of web design, CSS (cascading style sheets) brings the visual side of a website or app to life, implementing everything from fonts and themes to colors and icons<br />
    JavaScript – the scripting language that takes something static and gives it life. JavaScript is what makes it possible to interact with a website or app<br />
    </text>,
    title_four: "Soft skills",
    desc_four: <text>
    Problem solving<br />
    Frontend development involves  a whole range of complex problems and challenges. Overcoming potentially stressful situations with clear, creative thinking is a big part of what makes a frontend developer successful.<br />
    <br />
    Communication skills<br />
    Being able to clearly express ideas and listen to the ideas of others is an important part of the frontend development process. From design debates to technical discussions, a frontend developer must be able to get involved with strategies in a positive way.<br />
    <br />
    Creativity<br />
    A big part of being a frontend developer is about using tools and technologies to play with ideas and conventions and create something that resonates with the user. Having a flair for graphic design and the imagination to create an interface that’s fast, flowing and captivating will set you apart.<br />
    </text>,
    title_five: "Frontend development frameworks and libraries",
    desc_five: <text>
    Bootstrap<br />
    A free and open-source CSS framework, Bootstrap enables frontend developers to quickly design and customise mobile-first websites and apps. It comes with a huge array of reusable codes written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to give developers a comprehensive set of tools to get creative. Hugely popular over the last few years, Bootstrap still holds its own alongside the most popular frontend frameworks out there.<br />
    <br />
    AngularJS<br />
    One of the most commonly used frameworks for frontend development, AngularJS is an open-source framework for JavaScript that is used to develop single page web applications, or SPAs.Maintained by Google and a community of corporations and individuals, it’s fully extensible and can be used alongside other libraries. As some apps work better than others with AngularJS, developers should be aware of when and when not to use it.<br />
    <br />
    React.js<br />
    Another open-source, free to use library, React.js is used to build highly efficient UIs. The most widely used frontend JavaScript library for building the view layer for mobile and web applications, React.js also enables frontend developers to create reusable UI components. It’s fast, scalable and simple to use, hence its popularity.<br />
    <br />
    jQuery<br />
    jQuery takes time-consuming tasks that need many lines of code and converts them into methods that only use a single line of code. It’s an open-source JavaScript library that deals with everything from HTML/DOM manipulation, AJAX interactions and cross-browser JavaScript development, essentially making it easier to utilise JavaScript on your website. <br />

    title_one: "5 Surprising Ways to Find Work-Life Balance",
    desc_one: "You’ve learned to say “no” to taking on unnecessary commitments and you’re even getting more (and better quality) sleep these days. Still, you’re not feeling the work-life balance benefits. As the stakes get higher, you might have to dig deeper for solutions. Consider the following...",
    title_two: "1. Designate work-free zones",
    desc_two: "ust as invisible fences protect pets from wandering into the street, you can create a metaphorical “fence” that prohibits work activity in a specific area of your home or life. Whether it’s your car, your kitchen, or the elliptical machine, make sure your cell phone and laptop are out of earshot to eliminate work-induced distractions.",
    title_three: "2. Consider relocation",
    desc_three: "While not everyone has the ability to pack up their belongings and move, the truth is that some cities are more conducive to creating work-life balance than others. Do you spend a lot of time commuting to work every day — or a hefty amount of your paycheck on private school tuition? If you are in the midst of a career shift, this might be a good time to think about relocating to an area that offers more convenience. Moving to a city with a lower cost of living could restore work-life balance by alleviating the pressure to work an unreasonable number of hours just to cover everyday expenses.",
    title_four: "3. Ask for flex-time",
    desc_four: "When you’re juggling the demands of work and family, sometimes an hour on either end of your day can make all the difference in achieving work-life balance. As long as you fulfill your responsibilities, see if your boss will allow you to work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. instead of from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in order to avoid after-school care for your kids.",
    title_five: "4. Consolidate your calendar",
    desc_five: "While it may seem counterintuitive as you try to un-blur the line between work and life, keeping one calendar forces you to balance the two by not overbooking your schedule. If you see that you have already committed to take your mother to an important medical appointment at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday, you’ll be able to avoid booking a conference call with the Texas office at that time. If it’s important to you that you attend your daughter’s parent-teacher conference, reserve that time on your calendar. Proactively scheduling your calendar — in one central system — will allow you to maintain better control of your work-life balance.",
    title_six: "5. Expect the unexpected",
    desc_six: "Do you know what happens to a rubber band when it’s stretched to its capacity? All it takes from that point is one extra pull, and it will snap. If your daily schedule is like the rubber band at capacity, then receiving an urgent request from your number one client — just as you’re putting on your coat to leave for a parent-teacher conference — is enough to make you feel as if you might snap. Unless you have a crystal ball to foresee traffic jams, sick days or heated discussions that cause meetings to run long, there will always be the potential for something to alter your course, regardless of how carefully you’ve crafted it. By building cushion time into your schedule, you not only avoid an unnecessary cortisol rush, but you also stand a better chance of preserving your work-life balance.",
